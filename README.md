# Software Technologies Project

I really hope that we can get done with this project before the end of May, and build something that can impress recruiters,
So my teammates Chaimae, Dita, and Ussayed let's do it :)

## Project Development Process

### Phase 1: Planning and Setup

- Set up project repository on GitHub
- Set up local development environments for team members
- Define project requirements and objectives: _This involves identifying what the project aims to achieve and what features and functionalities it should have._
- Determine project scope and limitations: _This task involves setting boundaries for the project, outlining what it will and will not include._
- Create a project timeline and milestones: \*This task involves creating a roadmap for the project, breaking down the work into smaller, manageable tasks and setting deadlines for each task, let's put in our mind that the deadline is the **_30th of May_**.\*

### Phase 2: Design and Front-end Development

- Design the interface of the project: _This task involves designing the user interface and user experience before we go ahead and start implemnting it, like what we did in system engneenring, using this website `https://moqups.com/` or any other websites_
- Design and implement UI/UX using Angular and CSS: _This task involves designing the user interface and user experience using Angular and CSS. It includes creating and implementing a style guide, color schemes, typography, and other design elements._
- Implement responsive design for mobile devices: _This task involves designing and implementing the web application to be responsive, meaning it should adjust to different screen sizes and be optimized for use on mobile devices. (additionl feature)_
- These are the main tasks for now, then when we agree on a project idea there will be more tasks.

### Phase 3: Back-end Development

- Design and implement database schema: _This involves designing and creating the database tables and relationships required to store the application data. like what we did in system engneenring, using this website `https://drawsql.app/` or any other websites_
- Implement user authentication and authorization: _This involves setting up the necessary authentication and authorization mechanisms to allow users to securely access and manage their accounts and information._
- These are the main tasks for now, then when we agree on a project idea there will be more tasks.

### Phase 4: Testing

- Implement unit testing: _I do no have any idea on how to do this, but I remember the professer said he will teach as this, and we have to implement it_
- Fix and catch any errors or bugs.
